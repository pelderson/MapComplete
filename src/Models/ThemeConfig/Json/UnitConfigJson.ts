/**
 * In some cases, a value is represented in a certain unit (such as meters for heigt/distance/..., km/h for speed, ...)
 *
 * Sometimes, multiple denominations are possible (e.g. km/h vs mile/h; megawatt vs kilowatt vs gigawatt for power generators, ...)
 *
 * This brings in some troubles, as there are multiple ways to write it (no denomitation, 'm' vs 'meter' 'metre', ...)
 *
 * Not only do we want to write consistent data to OSM, we also want to present this consistently to the user.
 * This is handled by defining units.
 *
 * # Rendering
 *
 * To render a value with long (human) denomination, use {canonical(key)}
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * First of all, you define which keys have units applied, for example:
 *
 * ```
 * units: [
 *  appliesTo: ["maxspeed", "maxspeed:hgv", "maxspeed:bus"]
 *  applicableUnits: [
 *      ...
 *  ]
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * ApplicableUnits defines which is the canonical extension, how it is presented to the user, ...:
 *
 * ```
 * applicableUnits: [
 * {
 *     canonicalDenomination: "km/h",
 *     alternativeDenomination: ["km/u", "kmh", "kph"]
 *     default: true,
 *     human: {
 *         en: "kilometer/hour",
 *         nl: "kilometer/uur"
 *     },
 *     humanShort: {
 *         en: "km/h",
 *         nl: "km/u"
 *     }
 * },
 * {
 *     canoncialDenomination: "mph",
 *     ... similar for miles an hour ...
 * }
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 *
 * If this is defined, then every key which the denominations apply to (`maxspeed`, `maxspeed:hgv` and `maxspeed:bus`) will be rewritten at the metatagging stage:
 * every value will be parsed and the canonical extension will be added add presented to the other parts of the code.
 *
 * Also, if a freeform text field is used, an extra dropdown with applicable denominations will be given
 *
