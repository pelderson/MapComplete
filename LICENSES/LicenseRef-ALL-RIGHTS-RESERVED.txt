ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

This file is used within the software project because permission was granted to this software project, either implicit or explicit.
However, there is no other specific license for this file, thus making it unsuited for reuse.

For example:

- permission was asked and obtained to use it, but without granting an open license
- artwork was designed for a commissioned part of the software, but this artwork was not released under a specific license
- a font or icon is used to use the correct style of the organisation ordering a part of the software. This does not give third-parties the right to reuse those fonts
