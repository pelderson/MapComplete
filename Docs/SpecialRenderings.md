 Special tag renderings 
========================



In a tagrendering, some special values are substituted by an advanced UI-element. This allows advanced features and visualizations to be reused by custom themes or even to query third-party API's.

General usage is `{func_name()}`, `{func_name(arg, someotherarg)}` or `{func_name(args):cssStyle}`. Note that you _do not_ need to use quotes around your arguments, the comma is enough to separate them. This also implies you cannot use a comma in your args



#### Using expanded syntax 



Instead of using `{"render": {"en": "{some_special_visualisation(some_arg, some other really long message, more args)} , "nl": "{some_special_visualisation(some_arg, een boodschap in een andere taal, more args)}}`, one can also write


```
{
  "render": {
    "special": {
      "type": "some_special_visualisation",
      "argname": "some_arg",
      "message": {
        "en": "some other really long message",
        "nl": "een boodschap in een andere taal"
      },
      "other_arg_name": "more args"
    },
    "before": {
      "en": "Some text to prefix before the special element (e.g. a title)",
      "nl": "Een tekst om voor het element te zetten (bv. een titel)"
    },
    "after": {
      "en": "Some text to put after the element, e.g. a footer"
    }
  }
}
```


In other words: use `{ "before": ..., "after": ..., "special": {"type": ..., "argname": ...argvalue...}`. The args are in the `special` block; an argvalue can be a string, a translation or another value. (Refer to class `RewriteSpecial` in case of problems)

 A small map showing the selected feature. 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
zoomlevel | 18 | The (maximum) zoomlevel: the target zoomlevel after fitting the entire feature. The minimap will fit the entire feature, then zoom out to this zoom level. The higher, the more zoomed in with 1 being the entire world and 19 being really close
idKey | id | (Matches all resting arguments) This argument should be the key of a property of the feature. The corresponding value is interpreted as either the id or the a list of ID's.

------ | --------- | -------------
feature_ids | _undefined_ | A JSON-serialized list of IDs of features to apply the tagging on
keys | _undefined_ | One key (or multiple keys, seperated by ';') of the attribute that should be copied onto the other features.
text | _undefined_ | The text to show on the button
autoapply | _undefined_ | A boolean indicating wether this tagging should be applied automatically if the relevant tags on this object are changed. A visual element indicating the multi_apply is still shown
overwrite | _undefined_ | If set to 'true', the tags on the other objects will always be overwritten. The default behaviour will be to only change the tags on other objects if they are either undefined or had the same value before the change
 

#### Example usage of multi_apply

### plantnet_detection 

 Sends the images linked to the current object to plantnet.org and asks it what plant species is shown on it. The user can then select the correct species; the corresponding wikidata-identifier will then be added to the object (together with `source:species:wikidata=plantnet.org AI`).  

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
image_key | image,mapillary,image,wikidata,wikimedia_commons,image,image | The keys given to the images, e.g. if <span class='literal-code'>image</span> is given, the first picture URL will be added as <span class='literal-code'>image</span>, the second as <span class='literal-code'>image:0</span>, the third as <span class='literal-code'>image:1</span>, etc... Multiple values are allowed if ';'-separated 
 

#### Example usage of plantnet_detection 

 `{plantnet_detection(image,mapillary,image,wikidata,wikimedia_commons,image,image)}`



### tag_apply 

 Shows a big button; clicking this button will apply certain tags onto the feature.

The first argument takes a specification of which tags to add.
These can either be a tag to add, such as `amenity=fast_food` or can use a substitution, e.g. `addr:housenumber=$number`.
This new point will then have the tags `amenity=fast_food` and `addr:housenumber` with the value that was saved in `number` in the original feature.

If a value to substitute is undefined, empty string will be used instead.

This supports multiple values, e.g. `ref=$source:geometry:type/$source:geometry:ref`

Remark that the syntax is slightly different then expected; it uses '$' to note a value to copy, followed by a name (matched with `[a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`). Sadly, delimiting with `{}` as these already mark the boundaries of the special rendering...

Note that these values can be prepare with javascript in the theme by using a [calculatedTag](calculatedTags.md#calculating-tags-with-javascript)
  

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
tags_to_apply | _undefined_ | A specification of the tags to apply. This is either hardcoded in the layer or the `$name` of a property containing the tags to apply. If redirected and the value of the linked property starts with `{`, the other property will be interpreted as a json object
message | _undefined_ | The text to show to the contributor
image | _undefined_ | An image to show to the contributor on the button
id_of_object_to_apply_this_one | _undefined_ | If specified, applies the the tags onto _another_ object. The id will be read from properties[id_of_object_to_apply_this_one] of the selected object. The tags are still calculated based on the tags of the _selected_ element
maproulette_task_id | _undefined_ | If specified, this maproulette-challenge will be closed when the tags are applied
 

#### Example usage of tag_apply 

 `{tag_apply(survey_date=$_now:date, Surveyed today!)}`, `{tag_apply(addr:street=$addr:street, Apply the address, apply_icon.svg, _closest_osm_id)



### import_button 

 This button will copy the point from an external dataset into OpenStreetMap


Note that the contributor must zoom to at least zoomlevel 18 to be able to use this functionality.
    It is only functional in official themes, but can be tested in unoffical themes.

#### Specifying which tags to copy or add

    The argument `tags` of the import button takes a `;`-seperated list of tags to add (or the name of a property which contains a JSON-list of properties).

These can either be a tag to add, such as `amenity=fast_food` or can use a substitution, e.g. `addr:housenumber=$number`.
This new point will then have the tags `amenity=fast_food` and `addr:housenumber` with the value that was saved in `number` in the original feature.

If a value to substitute is undefined, empty string will be used instead.

This supports multiple values, e.g. `ref=$source:geometry:type/$source:geometry:ref`

Remark that the syntax is slightly different then expected; it uses '$' to note a value to copy, followed by a name (matched with `[a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`). Sadly, delimiting with `{}` as these already mark the boundaries of the special rendering...

Note that these values can be prepare with javascript in the theme by using a [calculatedTag](calculatedTags.md#calculating-tags-with-javascript)
 
#### Importing a dataset into OpenStreetMap: requirements

If you want to import a dataset, make sure that:

1. The dataset to import has a suitable license
2. The community has been informed of the import
3. All other requirements of the [import guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines) have been followed

There are also some technicalities in your theme to keep in mind:

1. The new feature will be added and will flow through the program as any other new point as if it came from OSM.
    This means that there should be a layer which will match the new tags and which will display it.
2. The original feature from your geojson layer will gain the tag '_imported=yes'.
    This should be used to change the appearance or even to hide it (eg by changing the icon size to zero)
3. There should be a way for the theme to detect previously imported points, even after reloading.
    A reference number to the original dataset is an excellent way to do this
4. When importing ways, the theme creator is also responsible of avoiding overlapping ways.

#### Disabled in unofficial themes

The import button can be tested in an unofficial theme by adding `test=true` or `backend=osm-test` as [URL-paramter](URL_Parameters.md).
The import button will show up then. If in testmode, you can read the changeset-XML directly in the web console.
In the case that MapComplete is pointed to the testing grounds, the edit will be made on https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org
 

name | default | description
------ | --------- | -------------
targetLayer | _undefined_ | The id of the layer where this point should end up. This is not very strict, it will simply result in checking that this layer is shown preventing possible duplicate elements
tags | _undefined_ | The tags to add onto the new object - see specification above. If this is a key (a single word occuring in the properties of the object), the corresponding value is taken and expanded instead
text | Import this data into OpenStreetMap | The text to show on the button
icon | ./assets/svg/addSmall.svg | A nice icon to show in the button
snap_onto_layers | _undefined_ | If a way of the given layer(s) is closeby, will snap the new point onto this way (similar as preset might snap). To show multiple layers to snap onto, use a `;`-seperated list
max_snap_distance | 5 | The maximum distance that the imported point will be moved to snap onto a way in an already existing layer (in meters). This is previewed to the contributor, similar to the 'add new point'-action of MapComplete
note_id | _undefined_ | If given, this key will be read. The corresponding note on OSM will be closed, stating 'imported'
maproulette_id | _undefined_ | The property name of the maproulette_id - this is probably `mr_taskId`. If given, the maproulette challenge will be marked as fixed. Only use this if part of a maproulette-layer.
 

#### Example usage of import_button 

 `{import_button(,,Import this data into OpenStreetMap,./assets/svg/addSmall.svg,,5,,)}`



### import_way_button 

 This button will copy the data from an external dataset into OpenStreetMap, copying the geometry and adding it as a 'line'


Note that the contributor must zoom to at least zoomlevel 18 to be able to use this functionality.
    It is only functional in official themes, but can be tested in unoffical themes.

#### Specifying which tags to copy or add

    The argument `tags` of the import button takes a `;`-seperated list of tags to add (or the name of a property which contains a JSON-list of properties).

These can either be a tag to add, such as `amenity=fast_food` or can use a substitution, e.g. `addr:housenumber=$number`.
This new point will then have the tags `amenity=fast_food` and `addr:housenumber` with the value that was saved in `number` in the original feature.

If a value to substitute is undefined, empty string will be used instead.

This supports multiple values, e.g. `ref=$source:geometry:type/$source:geometry:ref`

Remark that the syntax is slightly different then expected; it uses '$' to note a value to copy, followed by a name (matched with `[a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`). Sadly, delimiting with `{}` as these already mark the boundaries of the special rendering...

snap_to_point_if | _undefined_ | Points with the given tags will be snapped to or moved
max_snap_distance | 0.05 | If the imported object is a LineString or (Multi)Polygon, already existing OSM-points will be reused to construct the geometry of the newly imported way
move_osm_point_if | _undefined_ | Moves the OSM-point to the newly imported point if these conditions are met
max_move_distance | 0.05 | If an OSM-point is moved, the maximum amount of meters it is moved. Capped on 20m
snap_onto_layers | _undefined_ | If no existing nearby point exists, but a line of a specified layer is closeby, snap to this layer instead
snap_to_layer_max_distance | 0.1 | Distance to distort the geometry to snap to this layer
 

#### Example usage of import_way_button 

 `{import_way_button(,,Import this data into OpenStreetMap,./assets/svg/addSmall.svg,,0.05,,0.05,,0.1)}`



### conflate_button 

 This button will modify the geometry of an existing OSM way to match the specified geometry. This can conflate OSM-ways with LineStrings and Polygons (only simple polygons with one single ring). An attempt is made to move points with special values to a decent new location (e.g. entrances)


Note that the contributor must zoom to at least zoomlevel 18 to be able to use this functionality.
    It is only functional in official themes, but can be tested in unoffical themes.

The import button can be tested in an unofficial theme by adding `test=true` or `backend=osm-test` as [URL-paramter](URL_Parameters.md).
The import button will show up then. If in testmode, you can read the changeset-XML directly in the web console.
In the case that MapComplete is pointed to the testing grounds, the edit will be made on https://master.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org
