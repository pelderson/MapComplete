# Sponsors

For transparency, here is a short overview of sponsors to MapComplete. 
This ties in closely to the history of the project as well.

## Current sponsors

There is a [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/pietervdvn).

NL-Net is currently sponsoring Pietervdvn as well [for specific improvements](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ANLNet). 

## Historical sponsors

The following organisations ordered a theme to Pieter Vander Vennet and thus sponsered the project.
As these projects are finished, they have no relation with the project anymore.

### Brussels Mobility (OSOC 2020)

When the first version of Buurtnatuur.be was online, Brussels Mobility sponsored an [Open Summer of Code Project](https://osoc.be/editions/2020/cyclofix), resulting in the cyclofix theme.
The codebase was refactored in order to support multiple themes just before the start of OSOC.


### Belgian Green Party (2020)

The first version of what would later become 'MapComplete' was financed by the Belgian Green Party.
With the Corona-lockdown in full swing, they wanted to do something with _nature and green spaces near people, maybe inventorizing all parks, forests and nature reserves_.

[The original website](https://buurtnatuur.be/) can still be visited, the oldest version still online.
