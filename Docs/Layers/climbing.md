 climbing 
==========





A dummy layer which contains tagrenderings, shared among the climbing layers






  - This layer is shown at zoomlevel **19** and higher
  - Elements don't have a title set and cannot be toggled nor will they show up in the dashboard. If you import this layer in your theme, override `title` to make this toggleable.
  - Not visible in the layer selection by default. If you want to make this layer toggable, override `name`
  - Not rendered on the map by default. If you want to rendering this on the map, override `mapRenderings`


This is a special layer - data is not sourced from OpenStreetMap
