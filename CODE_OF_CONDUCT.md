MapComplete is currently a small project with little contributors where we try to make it pleasant for everyone.

As such, if you interact with anyone, please be polite. Some hints on general interactions:

- Everyone makes mistakes. Be forgiving if someone makes one - either technical or social.
- People might have little time, might be tired, might be stressed about events in their life, ... Furhtermore, not everyone has the same communication skills (due to a different native language, different culture or different neurological forms) 
  As a result, communications might be written in a way that might sound angry or unfriendly.
  If you experience such feelings, make sure to read your post again for tone (or postpone writing till a later time).
  If you read a message which sounds harsh, take a step back. The hard words might be unintentional, written during such a time. Be forgiving.
- Try to be complete in your communication. Try to imagine what the person on the other side might not know yet and include this information.
- Disagreements often come from different assumptions and/or perspective. In a disagreement, try to state what reasoning leads to the result.

## Behaviour that will not be tolerated

- Any hate speech. Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic... or similar will not be tolerated
- Spam, trolling, flame wars, ...

Such behaviours might result in bans.
